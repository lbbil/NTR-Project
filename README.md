# Stimulus Sequencer Program

Given a list of numbers, this program generates sequences of lists such that numbers that were previously neighbors are not next to each other in successive lists. Neighbors are defined as numbers that are 4 indices to the left or right of a index.

This program was initially used for an fMRI study to randomly sequence words.

## Constraints

The program will generate lists until it can and throw a IllegalArgumentException if all the lists requested were not able to be generated. In this situation, you will have to run the program again until you are able to get the lists. Also, depending on the size of the list and number of lists requested, it may be impossible to generate the requested number of lists.

For the purposes of this fMRI project, we were successful in generating lists with 200+ numbers.
## Successful Run (4 lists of size 200)

The first list will always be outputted in sequential order. All lists are generated without error.
